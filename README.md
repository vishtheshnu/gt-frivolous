# Gregtech Frivolous
## Addon for GTCEu for the GTCEFu Modpack

<hr>

The modpack is pretty freaking insane, and I don't _just_ mean it's cool (even though it totally is).
It takes all of my dumb ideas for a Gregtech pack and sticks them together into an absolutely beautiful mess.

Feel free to use this repo to learn how to implement the more complicated features I had to figure out for myself.
It might save you time in figuring out how to do it yourself.

Please see the `learnings` folder for specific features.
